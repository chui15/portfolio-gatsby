Hello! Iâ€™m Christie - a developer and public health advocate with a passion for creating tangible products from simple ideas and promoting mental and personal wellbeing. I am currently based in Los Angeles and Orange County, CA. When I am not actively studying or working on a project, I enjoy drawing, playing the piano, and discovering new music.

I graduated from UC San Diego in June 2019 with a B.S. in Human Biology and am currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at CU Boulder. I believe that my unique academic background combining both fields of study allows me to provide a fresh perspective to any project or team that I have the privilege work on.

Candidly speaking, the aspect that I love the most about software development is the ability to create tangible products from simple ideas; the feeling of elation when a project comes to fruition will never grow old for me.
