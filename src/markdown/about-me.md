Hello! I'm Christie, a full-stack web developer with a passion for Biosciences and Technology. I am currently based in Los Angeles and Orange County, CA. When I am not actively working on a project, I enjoy playing the piano and discovering new music.

Candidly speaking, the aspect that I love the most about web development is the ability to create tangible products from simple ideas; the feeling of elation when a project comes to fruition will never grow old for me.
